# dotfiles

This repo is the place for my personal dotfiles.
Feel free to get inspiration from it :)

## Usage

The dotfiles are managed with yadm (see [here](https://yadm.io)).

### Quick start

For a quick start clone the dotfiles with

`yadm clone`

As for the rest: yadm basically functions as a git wrapper. So you can use commands like *add*, *push*, *commit*, etc.

Furhter info can be found under the [quick start guide](https://yadm.io/docs/getting_started).
